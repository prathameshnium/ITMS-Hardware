## 1. Overview
The measurement system has been developed entirely in-house and is hereafter referred to as the **Integrated Transport Measurement System (ITMS)**.

This repository serves as the digital archive for the **Supplementary Data** and **Open Source Hardware Design** associated with the development of the modular cryogenic measurement platform described in the upcoming manuscript. It contains the Bill of Materials (BOM), wiring schematics, and mechanical assembly descriptors required to reproduce the system.

The associated software, **[Python-based Instrument Control and Automation (PICA)](https://github.com/prathameshnium/PICA-Python-Instrument-Control-and-Automation)**, is maintained in a separate repository to ensure modularity.

## 2. Facility Capabilities
The hardware consists of three distinct measurement inserts (probes) optimised for operations in **Liquid Nitrogen (77 K - 320 K)** and **Quantum Design PPMS (5 K - 380 K, 14 T)** environments.

### Measurement Modes
1.  **Ultra-Low Resistance:** 4-Wire Delta Mode using Keithley 6221/2182.
2.  **High Impedance:** Electrometry & Pyroelectric Current using Keithley 6517B.
3.  **Dielectric and Magnetodielectric Spectroscopy:** Frequency-dependent profiling using Keysight E4980A.
4.  **Pyroelectric Characterisation:** Spontaneous polarisation measurement using Keithley 6517B.

## 3. System Modules
The repository is organised into modules corresponding to specific probe designs:

| Module Name | Environment | Primary Application | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Cryogenic Insert](./modules/cryo_probe)** | Liquid Nitrogen | Low-Noise Transport, Pyroelectric Current | **Active** |
| **[PPMS Interface](./modules/ppms_insert)** | QD PPMS | Magnetodielectric, Hall Effect | **Active** |
